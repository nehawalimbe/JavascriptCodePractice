/**
 You can search for a literal pattern with some flexibility with character classes. 
 Character classes allow you to define a group of characters you wish to match by placing them inside square ([ and ]) brackets.
For example, you want to match bag, big, and bug but not bog. You can create the regex /b[aiu]g/ to do this. The [aiu] is the character class that will only match the characters a, i, or u.

let bigStr = "big";
let bagStr = "bag";
let bugStr = "bug";
let bogStr = "bog";
let bgRegex = /b[aiu]g/;
bigStr.match(bgRegex);
bagStr.match(bgRegex);
bugStr.match(bgRegex);
bogStr.match(bgRegex);
In order, the four match calls would return the values ["big"], ["bag"], ["bug"], and null.

/**
 Test Cases
 You should find all 25 vowels.
Passed:Your regex vowelRegex should use a character class.
Passed:Your regex vowelRegex should use the global flag.
Passed:Your regex vowelRegex should use the case insensitive flag.
Passed:Your regex should not match any consonants.
